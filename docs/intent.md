# notion_gateway — Intent

notion_gateway is the Notion OS kernel:
- bootstraps a canonical Notion workspace (schemas-as-code)
- exposes stable HTTPS JSON endpoints
- delegates mutation execution to idempotent n8n workflows
- keeps Notion as the system of record

See repo `INTENT.md` for canonical spec. This doc aligns with Brain OS gold-standard docs.
